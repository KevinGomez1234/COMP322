Wack a mole!

Spiritd is a daemon that you create will spawn and terminate a child process upon receiving a signal. Spiritd creates a log file in the users HOME directory, USR1 signal kills mole1 process and USR2 kills mole 2 process. A mole will pop randomly in the log file after one of these calls.
